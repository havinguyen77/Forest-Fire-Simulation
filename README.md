# Forest-Fire-Simulation
This is a simulation project created through MakeSchool. 

The forest fire simulations are based off of this article: [Simulating the World Using Emoji](https://ncase.me/simulating/).

The user will set up the forest scene and press a start to see the simulation run. The program is on the "Invasive Species and Fires" scenario by default. The scenario can be changed in the update() method of the ForestFireSimulation.swift file. 


### The Scenarios 

##### Forest Fires Cause by Lightning
* Simulates random fires started by lightning
* called using thunderboltAndLightning()
* Inspired by "A Forest With Thunderbolt & Lightning, Very Very Frightening" 

##### Killing Trees to Save Trees
* Simulates how killing trees can help stop the spread of forest fires
* called using noMercy()
* Inspired by "A Forest Where You Show Trees No Mercy"

##### Invasive Species and Fires 
* Simulates how fires spread when there are trees of different spieces and that some species rely on fire for survival
* called using jerkTrees()
* Inspired by "A Forest Where Some Trees Are Total Jerks"
